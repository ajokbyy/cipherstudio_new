‚ö° CipherStudio: A Browser-Based React IDE
CipherStudio is a full-stack web application that functions as a simple, in-browser Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for building and previewing React components. It uses the Monaco Editor (the engine behind VS Code) for a familiar coding experience and a sandboxed iframe for live, isolated previews.

This project is built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and includes user authentication to save and load projects.

‚ú® Features
üíª In-Browser Code Editor: A rich text editor powered by @monaco-editor/react.

ü™Ñ Live Preview: A sandboxed iframe that transpiles and renders your React code in real-time.

üìÅ File Explorer: A simple file tree to navigate between App.js, index.js, and styles.css.

üîê User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and bcrypt for password hashing.

üíæ Save & Load Projects: Users can save their code to a MongoDB database and reload their projects from a personal dashboard.

üöÄ Tech Stack
Frontend (Client)
React 18

React Router (react-router-dom): For client-side routing (/, /ide/:projectId, /login).

Monaco Editor (@monaco-editor/react): The core code editor.

Babel Standalone (@babel/standalone): For in-browser JSX and ES6 transpilation.

Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.

Backend (Server)
Node.js: The runtime environment.

Express.js: The server framework for building the REST API.

MongoDB (with Mongoose): The NoSQL database to store user and project data.

JSON Web Tokens (jsonwebtoken): For stateless authentication.

Bcrypt.js (bcryptjs): For securely hashing user passwords.

CORS: To handle cross-origin requests between the client and server.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or later)

npm (or yarn)

MongoDB Atlas Account: A free cloud database is required.

1. Backend Setup (/server)
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://your-repo-url.com/project-name.git
cd project-name/server
Install server dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Create your environment file: Create a file named .env in the /server directory and add the following, replacing the placeholders with your own keys:

Code snippet

# Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<db-name>

# A strong, random string for signing JWTs
JWT_SECRET=your_super_strong_secret_key_here

# Port for the backend
PORT=5000
Run the backend server:

Bash

# For development (watches for changes)
npm run dev

# For production
npm start
Your backend API will be running at http://localhost:5000.

2. Frontend Setup (Client)
Assuming your React app is in the root or a /client folder.

Navigate to the client directory (from the root folder):

Bash

# If your React app is in the root
cd .. 

# If it's in a /client folder
# cd ../client 
Install client dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Run the React app:

Bash

npm start
Your React development server will open at http://localhost:3001 (or your configured port).

üìù API Endpoints
All API routes are prefixed with /api.

Auth Routes (/api/auth)
POST /register: Register a new user.

POST /login: Log in a user and receive a JWT.

Project Routes (/api/projects)
Requires x-auth-token in header.

GET /: Get all projects for the logged-in user.

POST /: Create a new, default project.

GET /:id: Get a specific project by its ID.

PUT /:id: Save/update a project's files and name.

üîÆ Future Improvements
S3 Integration: Move file storage from MongoDB strings to AWS S3 for better performance and scalability.

Dependency Management: Allow users to add npm packages.

Console Tab: Add a console panel to show console.log output and runtime errors from the iframe.

Sharable Projects: Create public, read-only links for projects.
